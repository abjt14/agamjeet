I would be posting the answer key to IOQM 2023 in this blog. I would be discussing the answers of IOQM with MOMCers. I am unable to update this blog instantaneously, so as I solve/discuss the problems, I will add the answers to **[this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FDiNijrESp3COx8n10qcHCOXoIR7tupq4sgsxT_jxaQ/edit?usp=sharing)** spreadsheet. Good luck for the exam folks!

As everyone knows, this was the hardest IOQM ever. I believe that Class 8-11 cutoff is $\leq 20$ in all states whereas Class 12 cutoff is $\leq 25$. My heartiest good luck to all aspirants for clearing IOQM :) 

6th September Edit: The official answer key is out! Check it out **[here](https://www.mtai.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IOQM_Sep_2023_Question-paper-with-answer-key.pdf)**. Also, the first RMO mock would likely be released next week. Stay tuned!
