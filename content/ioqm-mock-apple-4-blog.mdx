This is the fourth IOQM Mock test from MOMC. The problems are taken from [HMMT 2008 Guts Round](https://www.hmmt.org/www/archive/112) and [CMIMC 2022](https://cmimc.math.cmu.edu/math/past-problems/2022). All the credit and authorship of the problems belongs to their respective sources. There are plenty of great problems that I wasn't able to include in the mock. I encourage you to check them out as well.

Now I would discuss an awesome number theory problem from the mock. So if you are planning to attempt the mock, beware of the spoilers ahead.

**Problem 23** $\textbf{(CMIMC 2022 Team Round P13)}$ Let $F_n$ denote the $n$th Fibonacci number, with $F_0=0, F_1=1$ and $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$ for $n \geq 2$. There exists a unique two digit prime $p$ such that for all $n$, $p \mid F_{n+100}+F_n$. Find $p$.

**Solution:** We use the following two well known results regarding Fibonacci numbers:
- $\gcd(F_m,F_n) = F_{\gcd(m,n)}$. Call this fact $\dagger$.
- $p \mid F_{p-1} \iff p \equiv \pm 1 \pmod 5$ and $p \mid F_{p+1} \iff p \equiv \pm 2 \pmod 5$. Call this fact $\star$.

Firstly observe that $n=0 \implies p \mid F_{100}$. Let $F_{f(p)}$ be the minimal fibonacci number $F$ such that $p$ divides $F$. Now $\dagger$ implies that $p$ also divides $F_{f(p)k}$ . Further, fact $\star$ implies that $f(p)$ divides $p-1$ if $p\equiv \pm 1 \pmod 5$ and $p+1$ if $p \equiv \pm2 \pmod 5$.

Now let $F_{f(p)-1} \equiv j \pmod p$. Thus $F_{f(p)+1} \equiv F_{f(p)+2} \equiv j \pmod p$. Then $F_{f(p)+3} \equiv 2j \pmod p$ and so on. Thus $F_{f(p)+n} \equiv j \cdot F_{n} \pmod p$. Thus in order to have $F_{n+100} + F_n \equiv 0 \pmod p$ we must have $F_{n}(j+1) \equiv \pmod p$. As the greatest common divisor of all the fibonacci numbers is $1$, we must have $j \equiv -1 \pmod p$.

Now we begin our search for two digit prime factors of $F_{100}$. Observe that $f(p) \mid 100 \implies f(p) \in \{1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100 \}$. Clearly $p < 10$ if $f(p) \in \{1,2,3,4,5 \}$. If $f(p) = 10$ then $F_{10} = 55 \implies p = 11$ (as $5 \mid F_5 = 5$). We require that $F_9 \equiv -1 \pmod {11}$ but $F_9 = 34 \equiv 1 \pmod {11}$. If $f(p) = 20$ then further if $p \equiv \pm 1 \pmod 5$ then we need $f(p) \mid p-1$ and $p < 100$. There are two primes with this property: $p = 41,61$. Some tedious work shows that for $p=41$, both the required properties: $f(41) = 20$ and $F_{19} \equiv -1 \pmod {41}$ hold true. 

It is not very hard to show that this is the unique solution. Some calculations$\mod {61}$ show that $F_{19} \equiv 1 \pmod {61}$. Now if $p \equiv \pm 2 \pmod 5$ then we require $20 \mid p+1$ but $p + 1 \not \equiv 0 \pmod 5$, a contradiction! If $f(p) = 25,50,100$, then there doesn't exist a prime $p \equiv \pm 1 \pmod {f(p)}$ such that $p<100$. We are done!
