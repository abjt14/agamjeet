This is the eighth IOQM Mock test from MOMC. The problems are collected from Theme and Team Rounds from [HMMT 2021 and 2022](https://www.hmmt.org/www/archive/problems) and [BmMT 2018 and 2019](https://bmt.berkeley.edu/archive/) . All the credit and authorship of the problems belongs to their respective sources.

I admit that I usually design my mocks to be slightly (read: a lot) harder than the actual IOQM. The purpose of this is to prepare you for a harder-than-average test. However, as IOQM is closing in, I feel that it is not ideal to lower your confidence by giving a tough mock. Hence, I have tried my hardest to match this mock's difficulty with the real IOQM.

Still, the mock has some interesting aspects that entail some discussion. Firstly, P8 is a unique and creative problem as it is stated in terms of the answer itself! Although unlikely to appear in the real test, I feel that it is important to have a good temperament regarding encountering new problem types. Moreover, the geometry in this mock is highly non-standard. Problems 21-23 and 25 are a testament to this. Apart from that, a lack of algebra (a measly 5 marks) and an excess of geometry (a whopping 45 marks!) will definitely prove to be a challenge for non-geo mains.

On an unrelated note, I am super ecstatic about the fact that this blog has finally reached an astounding 5000 views! A big thanks to each one of you for viewing my blog :D

I feel that this is a good time to announce that after IOQM, we will be having weekly RMO mocks as well.
