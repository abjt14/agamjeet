This is the sixth IOQM Mock test from MOMC. The problems are mostly collected from [CMIMC 2018](https://cmimc.math.cmu.edu/math/past-problems/2018), with one problem each from [BMT 2022](https://bmt.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/algebra-solutions.pdf) and [AMC 8 2023](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h3001603p26952747).  All the credit and authorship of the problems belongs to their respective sources.

I was quite busy the last two weeks due to Pravega Enumeration and TOEFL. Pravega turned out quite well for me as we (Me and Malay, my teammate) did 6 computational and 3 subjective problems. I believe we have a reasonable chance of making the finals. Apart from that, the TOEFL wasn't too bad either. I am hoping for ~110/120 but you never know how strict they are in the speaking or writing section's grading.

Here are the CODS ratings for this mock:

| P21 | P22 | P23 | P24 | P25 | P26 | P27 | P28 | P29 | P30 |
| ---| --- | --- | ---| ---| --- | ---| ---| --- | ---  |
| 3 | 2 | 3  | 5  |  5 | 4  |3  |  2|  4 |  2 |
