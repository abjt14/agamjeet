This is the fifth IOQM Mock test from MOMC Season 3! The problems for this test are taken from [ARML 2017](https://www.arml2.com/arml_2017/public_contest_files/2017_contest_file/2017_Contest_Final_Version.pdf) and [HMMT 2015 February](https://www.hmmt.org/www/archive/252).

This mock test kicks off our Espresso series—a blend designed to be both rejuvenating and eye-opening! The test begins with a solid set of moderate to difficult 2 markers offering a well-balanced mix of all subjects. Some of the 3-markers, like P13 (common root from IOQM 2020) and P16 (nearest perfect squares from IOQM 2020), might evoke memories for IOQM veterans. As always, the 5-mark section is packed with intriguing features. To the dismay of all geometers, there are no traditional geometry problems this time! Instead, we have unconventional challenges like P22, P27, and P29. Additionally, we have 2 intriguing algebra problems: P23 and 24. The first is a classic polynomial problem, while the second one, though challenging, introduces something refreshingly new.

These are the CODS difficulty ratings for the 5 mark problems:

| P21 | P22 | P23 | P24 | P25 | P26 | P27 | P28 | P29 | P30 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 4   | 3   | 5   | 3   | 2   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 4   |
I hope this brew keeps you energized for a while. I'll be back with a fresh shot of espresso soon. Stay caffeinated!
