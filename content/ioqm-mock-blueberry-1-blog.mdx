This is the fifth IOQM Mock test from MOMC. The problems are collected from [CMC 2018 AMC 10 A](http://cmc.ericshen.net/CMC-2018/) and [CMC ARML 2020](http://cmc.ericshen.net/CMC-2020/). All the credit and authorship of the problems belongs to their respective sources.

My friends told me that the recent mocks were too hard, especially the 5 markers. So I have tried my best to lower their level while still keeping them challenging enough. Aside from that, I changed the mock formatting again. I have put all the ten 2 markers on the same page to make it overwhelming. Moreover the 5 markers are spread over only 2 pages, instead of the usual 3. Lastly, I was busy with my school exams this week, so I wasn't be able to review any problems from the mock this time.

This is the CODS difficulty rating for today's mock:

| P21 | P22 | P23 | P24 | P25 | P26 | P27 | P28 | P29 | P30 |
| ---| --- | --- | ---| ---| --- | ---| ---| --- | ---  |
| 4 | 3 | 1  | 1  |  1 | 3  |  3| 3 |  5 |  4 |
