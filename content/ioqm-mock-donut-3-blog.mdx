This is the third IOQM Mock test from MOMC Season 3! The problems for this test are taken from [CMIMC 2016](https://cmimc.math.cmu.edu/math/past-problems/2016) and [PUMaC 2011](https://jason-shi-f9dm.squarespace.com/archives#2011). All credit and authorship of the problems belong to their respective sources.

Before discussing the mock, I want to reiterate that MOMC Applications are still open! In fact, they will remain open until RMO takes place. However, applying early is highly advantageous as we admit participants on a rolling basis. You can find the application **[here](https://www.agamjeet.com/momc-season-3-application)**. Also, please remember to fill out **[this](https://forms.gle/hFp1MPsv3yUZ2Lwz7)** very short form about the mock test! You can find its results **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1seAkircZ_zyoN7Z3KRN46fO2yFmVJS0TgxazjdZC4gI/viewanalytics)**.

The mock presents some intriguing problems. It features all the main components of Algebra: Polynomials (P21), Algebraic Manipulation (P1, P22), Inequalities (P5, P22), Summation (P14, P23), and the Greatest Integer Function (P23)! I love Problem 14 because it reminds me of PRMO 2018 P16. It used to be one of my favourites during my preparation. In number theory, I couldn't resist including bashy problems. So I just had to include P17 there. On a brighter note, the 5-marker number theory problems are more Olympiad-esque yet still elementary. In geometry, we have a few construction problems (where you have to cleverly add a point) like P11 and P28.

This mock is actually a reboot of one of Season 1's mocks "JL3" (July 3). In Season 1, the mocks used to be extremely trivial. Problems like P1 used to come as 5-markers! We used to believe that they were too challenging and that the IOQM would "of course be a bit easier". Good ol' days!

These are the CODS difficulty ratings for the 5-mark problems:

| P21 | P22 | P23 | P24 | P25 | P26 | P27 | P28 | P29 | P30 |
