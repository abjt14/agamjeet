This is the third IOQM Mock test from MOMC. The problems are collected from [PuMaC 2018](https://pumac.princeton.edu/#index) and [CHMMC 2014](https://www.chmmc.org/). All the credit and authorship of the problems belongs to their respective sources.

I felt for a long time that there was no difficulty scale to express the difficulty of problems in IOQM or any other computational exam. So I decided to make one myself. Therefore I present to you- CODS (Computational Olympiad Difficulty Scale)! A difficulty scale ranging from 1-6 for IOQM 5 markers. As the 2 and 3 markers are no big deal, there is no point in making a difficulty scale for them. Hence this scale is only for 5 markers.

**Rating 1: Very Doable.** Problems rated 1 are very doable 5 markers. An example is: 

- IOQM 2023 P18 on LCM and GCD

**Rating 2: Mostly Doable.** Problems rated 2 are manageable. However, they aren't trivial and require some effort. Some examples are:

- IOQM 2023 P20 on Landmark Points
- IOQM 2023 P21 on 1 Hour Journeys of an Ant


**Rating 3: Moderate.** This is the rating at which students start facing some difficulty. Some examples are:

- IOQM 2023 P16 on System of equations
- IOQM 2023 P17 on $f(f(f(N)))=97$


**Rating 4: Challenging.** Problems of rating 4 form the more challenging end of the 5 markers. Most students cannot solve these. An example is:

- IOQM 2023 P14 on $\frac{x}{y+z} + \frac{y}{z+x} + \frac{z}{x+y} = 9$


**Rating 5: Very Challenging.** These are the hardest 5 markers that can be found in IOQM. Only a handful of students are able to solve these problems in the exam. Some examples are:

- IOQM 2023 P13 on $AD= BC$ and angles in arithmetic progression
- IOQM 2023 P22 on friendly binary sequences

**Rating 6: Unsuitable.** It's unlikely that such a difficulty will appear in the real IOQM, but you might encounter it in my mocks.

Here are some examples of ratings for this particular mock and previous mocks:
